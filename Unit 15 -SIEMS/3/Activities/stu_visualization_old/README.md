**Instructions**

- In this activity, you will use the `fortinet_logs.csv` file and create a search based on the following scenario: 
 
- Your boss has asked you to create a geographic display using the fortinet_logs.csv file of the top country that matches the following criteria: 
	
   - Source port is `3430`
	
   - Destination IP starts with `195`.
	
      ***Hint***:  Be sure to use `iplocation` as well as `geostats` in your search

   - Once you've identified the country, zoom in on the visualization so that only that country is displayed.
