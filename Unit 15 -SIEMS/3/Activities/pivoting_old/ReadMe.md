## Discovering Backups

**Instructions**

  - In this lab, you will create a pivot table showing all of the most recent backups. Using the `class_data_sheet.csv`, build the pivot table according to the following guidelines: 

  1. Create the Data model with the name `Backup`. Add the extracted fields
	
      - backupduration
	
      - backupvolume
   
      - usr
  
  2. Using the different chart capabilities that come with Splunk answer the following questions: 
       
      - Which user had the biggest backup volume?
      
      - Who had the smallest backup?
      
      - Whose back up took the longest?
