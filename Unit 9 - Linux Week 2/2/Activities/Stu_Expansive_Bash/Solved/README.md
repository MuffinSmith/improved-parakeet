- Run: `which --help`. What does the `which` command do?
  > **Solution**: `which <COMMAND>` tells you the absolute path to the executable for `<COMMAND>`.

- Use `file` and a command expansion with `which` to figure out what kind of file `ls` and `cp` are.
  - **Hint**: You'll need something like `$(which ...)` in your solution...
  > **Solution**: `file $(which ls)` and `file $(which cp)`.

## Extension

  * Use your Google-Fu to determine how you can create a variable that persists across shells and terminal windows and logins.
