# Breaking the Chain
## Instructions
### Drills
For this exercise, you'll use `&&`, `||`, and `;` to chain commands.
- Use `;` and `echo` to print: `First Message` and `Second Message`
- Use `&&` to create a directory _and then_ move into it.
- Run `cat nonexistent`. You should get an error. Use `||` to print: `"File not found :("` after trying to read `nonexistent`.
> **Solutions**
>   - `echo "First Message" ; echo "Second Message"`
>   - `mkdir New_Directory && cd New_Directory`
>   - `cat nonexistent || echo "File not found :("`

- Determine what the following commands will print:
  - `cat /etc/shade && echo "Shadow file dumped."`
  - `ping -c 3 target.com && echo "Target is up!" || echo "Target is down..."`
  - `ping -c 3 down.ste && echo "Target is up!" || echo "Target is down..."`

  > **Solutions**
  >   - This will print an error, because `/etc/shade` doesn't exist.
  >   - This will print output from `ping`, then `Target is UP!`
  >   - This will print output from `ping`, then `Target is down..."`

### SUccess vs Error

* Run the command `ls /etc ; echo ' ' ; ls /dev`
    > **Solution**: You should see the output of each command. The echo command just adds some space between the two outputs.

* Now run the command `ls /etc && echo ' ' && ls /dev`.
    * How is this different from the running the first command?
    * Is this what you expected to happen?
    * What happens if you change the command to: `ls none && echo ' ' && ls /dev`?
    > **Solutions**
    >   - This is identical to the first command.
    >   - Yes, because `;` and `&&` act the same if none of the commands in the chain throw errors.
    >   - Changing the command to `ls none` breaks the entire chain, because `ls none` throws an error.

* Finally, let's look at `ls /etc || echo ' ' || ls /dev`
  * What do you expect the output of this command to be?
  * After running this command, did you get the output you expected?
  * What should happen if we change this command to: `ls none || echo ' ' || ls /dev`?
    > **Solutions**
    >   - This should print the contents of `/etc`, and nothing else.
    >   - Yes. Only `/etc` prints, because `ls /etc` doesn't throw an error. So, `echo ' '` and `ls /dev` won't run.
    >   - Changing the first command to `ls none` results in the `echo ' ' ` running, but _not_ ` the `ls /dev`.
