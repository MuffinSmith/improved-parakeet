# Interpreting Snort Rules
In this exercise, you'll:
- Interpret the rules that fired in the previous exercise
- Interpret new rules
- Use the Snort documentation to research additional rule options

Refer to the Snort rule options documentation as you follow the instructions below: <http://manual-snort-org.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/node31.html>

**Good luck!**

## Instructions
Explain the below ICMP Echo Reply rules. Be sure to identify the:
- Action
- Protocol
- Source/destination addresses
- Meaning of each new rule option

```bash
alert icmp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET any (
    msg:"PROTOCOL-ICMP Echo Reply"; 
    icode:0; itype:0; 
    metadata:ruleset community; 
    classtype:misc-activity; 
    sid:408; 
    rev:8;)

alert icmp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET any (
    msg:"PROTOCOL-ICMP Echo Reply undefined code"; 
    icode:>0; 
    itype:0; 
    metadata:ruleset community; 
    classtype:misc-activity; 
    sid:409; 
    rev:10;)
```

Explain the ICMP Unusual PING rule below. Be sure to identify the:
- Action
- Protocol
- Source/destination addresses
- Meaning of each new rule option

```bash
alert icmp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (
    msg:"PROTOCOL-ICMP Unusual PING detected"; 
    icode:0; 
    itype:8; 
    fragbits:!M; 
    content:!"ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWABCDEFGHI"; depth:32;
    content:!"0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuv"; depth:32;
    content:!"EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"; depth:36;
    content:!"WANG2";
    content:!"cacti-monitoring-system"; depth:65;
    content:!"SolarWinds"; depth:72;
    metadata:ruleset community; 
    reference:url,krebsonsecurity.com/2014/01/a-closer-look-at-the-target-malware-part-ii/;
    reference:url,krebsonsecurity.com/2014/01/a-first-look-at-the-target-intrusion-malware/;
    classtype:successful-recon-limited;
    sid:29456;
    rev:2;)
```

- There are multiple `content` options in this rule. 
  - **Important Note**: There's an exclamation mark in front of each content string. Use the documentation to find out what this means.
  - Why do you suppose this rule includes so many?

Explain the rule below. Be sure to identify:
- Action
- Protocol
- Source/destination addresses
- Meaning of each new rule option

  ```bash
  alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET $HTTP_PORTS (
      msg:"SQL PK-CMS SQL injection attempt"; 
      flow:to_server,established; 
      content:"/default.asp?"; fast_pattern; nocase; http_uri;
      content:"pagina="; distance:0; http_uri; pcre:"/pagina=[^&]*\x27/Ui";
      metadata:service http; 
      reference:url,github.com/BuddhaLabs/PacketStorm-Exploits/blob/master/1309-exploits/pkcms-sql.txt;
      classtype:web-application-attack;
      sid:32768;
      rev:1;)
  ```


- Based on the reference URL, which exploit does this rule monitor for?

- Based on your knowledge of SQL injection and the rule above, which of the following carries the SQLi payload? What is the name of the parameter or header that is being attacked?
  - POST data
  - Unsanitized HTTP header
  - GET query parameters)
