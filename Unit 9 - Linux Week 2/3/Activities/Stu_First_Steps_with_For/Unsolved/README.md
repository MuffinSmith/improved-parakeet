# First Steps with For
Open the script in `first_for_unsolved.sh`. Use the comments to guide you, and then follow the instructions below.

## Instructions
- Write a `for` loop that prints out the messages:
  - `"Hello, Moe!"`
  - `"Hello, Larry!"`
  - `"Hello, Curly!"`

- Write a `for` loop that prints out the messages:
  - `"I've used Mac OS X."`
  - `"I've used Windows."`
  - `"I've used Linux."`

- Run the provided `for` loop. What does the `*` character mean?

  ```bash
  for FILE in *
  do
    echo "$FILE"
  done
  ```

- On your Terminal (_not_ in the script), run: `seq 1 10`. What does this do?

- Use `seq` and command expansion to print out the numbers between 1 and 24.
