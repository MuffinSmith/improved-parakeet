## Diving with the Wiresharks 

In this activity, you will break out into groups of 2-3. You will conduct a capture, investigate a packet capture file and answer a series of questions about the traffic in the file.

You will be tasked with learning to decipher the basics of the Wireshark interface yourselves. This will seem intimidating at first, but as cybersecurity professionals it will often be your responsibility to quickly learn new technologies on the fly.

### **Instructions**

* Using your own exploration or the Wireshark documentation, complete the following steps and answer the associated questions:
   * First, "Start a Capture". 
   * Allow the Wireshark capture to run for a few moments, before "Stopping" the capture.
   * Once stopped, take a few moments to answer the following questions. (Hint: You will need to do a bit of research!)

* **Questions**
   * What do the columns "No", "Time", and "Length" represent?  
   * What do the "Source" and "Destination" columns represent? How are they associated with one another
   * What does the "Protocol" column represent? What are a few prominent protocols that appear in your packet trace?
   * What does the "Info" column represent? How might you interpret if it states: "54492 -> 7437 Len=173"
   * What do the row colors signify? What does a green row signify? Blue? Black? Red?

* Once you've answered the above questions, begin clicking the various rows. Observe how the panels below change as a result.
   * Then take a few moments to answer the following questions:

* **Questions**
    * What is the significance of the *second* panel window (middle)?
    * What is the significance of the *third* panel window (bottom)?
    * What is the significance of the indecipherable numbers, letters, and symbols in the bottom window? What format is this data stored in?

* **Hint**:

     * If you need a place to start, look for the section titled "The Packet List" Pane in the Wireshark Documentation.
     * Don't worry if you can't decipher all the terms. We'll break them down in due time!
            
* **Bonus**:

   * If you finish early, start a new Wireshark capture, but this time immediately begin browsing the web while the capture is running. See if you can identify which rows (packets) are specifically relevant to your web browsing.
