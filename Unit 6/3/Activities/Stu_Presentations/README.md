## Presenting: Protocols

### Instructions

In this exercise, you'll work with a partner to research two new protocols. 

For each protocol you research, you'll provide:
- An Overview of the Protocol and its Purpose
- An Attack Involving the Protocol
- A Tactic for Mitigating the Above Attack 

After you've been paired with your partner, one of you shoud run  `select_protocols.py` to know which protocol you'll be working on. 

Once you've done your research and know what you want to present on, use Google Slides to create your presentation. 

Make sure to focus on the following specifics: 

#### Protocol Structure
*Description*
Whatâ€™s the purpose of this protocol? Which aspect of networking does it support? Which layer of the OSI model?

*Message Format*
What do requests look like? What do responses look like?

*Related Protocols*
Are there any similar or related protocols of note (e.g., HTTP vs HTTPS)?

#### Vulnerabilties and Attacks
*Structure*
Which aspect of the protocol is being exploited, and how is it being used differently than intended?

*Attack Scenario*
Describe a hypothetical attack scenario. How could the attack in your scenario have been prevented?

*Real-World Example*
If possible, provide an example of this attack being executed.
