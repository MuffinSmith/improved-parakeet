### Instructions:

  * You've just been given a folder filled with books.

  * Your task is to sift through each of the book files to identify which are text based.

  * Combine these files into a single text file called **full.txt**.

  * Confirm that the combination worked successfully, before moving the new file to a folder called **Summary**.

#### **Bonus:**
  * See if you can determine the correct file format of the non-text file. Rename the file extension and be ready to share what you found. **Hint:** Read the gibberish.
