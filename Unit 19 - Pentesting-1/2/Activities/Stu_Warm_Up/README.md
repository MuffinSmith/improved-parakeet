## Warm-Up Activity

In this activity, you'll use the Nmap documentation to learn useful new flags. Refer to the following documentation as you work through the following questions: <https://nmap.org/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html>

## Instructions 

  - Write an Nmap command to perform a ping sweep of the range `10.0.0.0` to `10.0.0.254`.
  
  - Write an Nmap command to perform a service/version scan of the live hosts you discover. Save the results as XML to `/tmp/results.txt`. 
  
  - Read about the `--top-ports` feature: <https://danielmiessler.com/blog/nmap-use-the-top-ports-option-for-both-tcp-and-udp-simultaneously/>. 
 
  - Use `--top-ports` to scan the top 100 ports of the live hosts you discovered above. Save the results to an XML file.
 
  - Use `--top-ports` to scan the top 20 ports of `scanme.nmap.org`. Save the results as a "normal" file.
