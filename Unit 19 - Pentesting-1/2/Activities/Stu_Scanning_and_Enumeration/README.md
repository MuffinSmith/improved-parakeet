# Scanning and Enumeration
Launch the [Linux Exploitation](https://cybrscore.learnondemand.net/Lab/28535). Then, follow the instructions below.

## Instructions
- Start by using ZenMap to perform host discovery on the range `10.0.0.90-10.0.0.110`.

- Use ZenMap to perform an intense scan on any host you discover.

- Test both machines for vulnerability to Shellshock. 
  - **Hint**: Use the `uri` script argument to test `/cgi-bin`, `/cgi-bin/bin`, `/cgi-bin/status.cgi`, and any other common CGI script names you can enumerate.

- Perform a Nessus scan of all live hosts. Document the 3 most critical vulnerabilities identified by Nessus. Export the scan results in PDF format. 
- 
- You'll find Heartbleed in the scan results when it completes. While you wait, use the FAQ to answer the questions below: <http://heartbleed.com>
    - Why it is called the Heartbleed Bug?
    - What makes the Heartbleed Bug unique?
    - What is being leaked?
    - What is leaked primary key material and how to recover?
    - What is leaked protected content and how to recover?
    - What is leaked collateral and how to recover?
    - What versions of the OpenSSL are affected?
    - How common are the vulnerable OpenSSL versions?
