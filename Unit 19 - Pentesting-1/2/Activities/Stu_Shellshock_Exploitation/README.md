## Instructions
- Launch the [Linux Exploitation](https://cybrscore.learnondemand.net/Lab/28535) lab.
- Scan your subnet for live hosts. Identify the host(s) running an Apache HTTP server.
- Use Metasploit to `search` for Metasploit modules related to Shellshock.
- Use Metasploit to scan live hosts for the Shellshock vulnerability.
  - **Hint**: Check the `/cgi-bin/status.cgi` endpoint. Look for a `auxiliary` module.
