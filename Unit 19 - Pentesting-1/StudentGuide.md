## Pentesting Week 1

### Topics for This Week

This week we will get our feet wet with the first part of a Pen Test: Intelligence Gathering and Exploitation.

At the end of this week, you should be able to:
- Use Searchsploit to research exploits and scripts related to Heartbleed.
- Identify hosts vulnerable to Heartbleed.
- Use Metasploit to exploit Heartbleed and Shellshock.
- Perform intense scans of target hosts using Zenmap.
- Identify specific vulnerabilities like Shellshock using Nmap NSE.
- Send injection payloads to vulnerable servers using Burp Repeater.

### Homework for This Week
This week, after studying the penetration testing process, you'll review and build on what you learned by scanning a network and exploiting targets much the same way you did in class, but without the guidance of your instructor.

The lab consists of four parts:
- Host Discovery
- Verification of Scan Data
- Target Host service Enumeration
- Exploitation of a Linux host

You'll be required to use everything you learned in class to complete the lab. The most important tools are:
- nmap / ZenMap
- Metasploit
- Burp Suite

### Why We Care | Job Titles Related to These Skills
Pentesting weeks are all about Penetration Testing. Penetration Testing is a high paying role with an average U.S. Salary of $95k/year. Vulnerability Aanlyst, or completing Vulnerability assessments is also a related role that pays very well.

### Links for Self Study
Here you will find links to references to use if you are having trouble and more reading to complete if you would like to dive deeper into Penetration Testing and/or Vulnerability Assessment. We recommend waiting until the class is over to add this material to your plate.
