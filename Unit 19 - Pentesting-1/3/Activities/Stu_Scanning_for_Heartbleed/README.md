### Scanning for Heartbleed

**Instructions**:

  - Use `searchsploit` to identify Heartbleed exploits.

  - Inspect the Python exploits you identify:

    - What do they do?

    - What's the difference between the exploits you found?

  - Move to the directory containing the original exploit and attempt to run it.

  - Use Nmap to scan your local subnet.

  - Run the scripts you found with `searchsploit` against each host you discover. Record which ones are vulnerable.
- Launch a terminal.
