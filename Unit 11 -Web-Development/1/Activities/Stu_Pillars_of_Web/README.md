# Client-Side Assets

## Instructions

### Inspecting HTML
- Open [index.html](index.html) in a text editor.
  - List all the links that the browser will download when loading the page.
  - Identify the links that require CORS requests.

- Open [index.html](index.html) in the browser.

- Enter a name in the form, and hit **Submit**. Note which part of the page changes.

- Look at the HTML in your text editor, or use `view-source` to see it in the browser. Find the text that changed when you submitted the name.
  - Which tag contains the name?
  - Which attribute does the tag have?

- Look at the HTML for the input where you entered your nameâ€”it's contained in the `input` tag.
  - Which attribute does this share with the tag you identified in the step above?

### Inspecting CSS
Next, you'll make some changes to a CSS file to see how it affects the appearance of the web page.

- Open `styles.css`. 

- Look at the line at the top. 
  - Explain what this statement does.
  - Explain why this functionality might introduce a security vulnerability.

- Uncomment the line containing the `font-family` property by removing the `/*...*/` around the CSS rule. Return to the browser, and reload the page.
  - This shows the result of downloading and applying a custom font via a CSS rule.

- Finally, change the value of the `color` property to, e.g., `tomato`, and reload the web page.

### Tinkering with JavaScript
Finally, you'll see how JavaScript can be used to update an HTML page after page load.

- Submit another name in the form, e.g.: `Jane`.

- Next, submit the name, but wrapped in HTML, e.g.: `<p>Jane</p>`. Also try:
  - `<h2>Jane</h2>`
  - `<h2 style="color: blue;">Jane</h2>`

- Right-click on the name, and select **Inspect Element**.

- Explain what happens when you:
  - Submit the form with a normal name, e.g.: `Jane`
  - Submit the form with HTML name, e.g.: `Jane`
  
- Finally, explain one way in which this functionality could be leveraged to exploit users.
