**Articles**
- The Marriott Breach (500 million records): https://nbcnews.to/2Paeo6w
- The Under Armor Breach (150 million records): https://bit.ly/2Je8b7V
- The UnityPoint Health Beach (1.4 million records): https://bit.ly/2OCdnVN

**Questions**
- What was the cause of each breach?
- How could each breach have been prevented?
- What was the impact of each leak? Include both user and financial impact.

  > **Solutions**
  >   - The **Marriott Breach** was caused by unauthorized database access. It could have been prevented with tighter controls on database access. The leak affected over 500 million guests.
  >   - The main failure in the **Under Armor** breach was that not all data was strongly encrypted. This means that leaked data is susceptible to cracking attempts. This vulnerability could have been addressed by using `bcrypt` to encrypt _all_data. Around 150 million users were affected.
  >  - The **UnityPoint Health** breach was the result of a phishing attack. This could have been prevented with better employee training. Over 1.4 million customers were affected.
