# Weak Session IDs
In this exercise, you will use Burp suite to study DVWA's weak session ID algorithm.

Launch DVWA by running: `start_dvwa`

Then, use Firefox to navigate to `http://localhost`.

Click **Create / Reset Database**, then log in with the same credentials as above.

Navigate to **DVWA Security**, and make sure your securty level is set to low.

**Good luck!**

## Instructions
- Navigate to the **Weak Session ID** vulnerabilty.

- Right-click anywhere in the page, and select **Inspect Element**. Click the **Storage** tab in the top navbar of the developer's panel, then click **Cookies** in the left sidebar.

- Click **Generate**. Look for the `dvwaSession` cookie.
  > **Solution**: It sets a `dvwaSession` cookie, with the value `1`.

- Click **Generate** again, and look at your new session ID. 
  - When you click **Generate** a third time, what will your session ID be?
  > **Solution**: Your new session IDs are 1, 2, 3.

- Navigate to **DVWA Security**, and set the security level to medium

- Generate a few session IDs. Which part of your session ID doesn't change?
  > **Solution**: I get IDs like `1549243737`, `1549243757`, and `1549243786`. The last three digits change, but the first part—`1549243`—stays constant.

- Weak session IDs can expose users to having their session hijacked. If your session IDs are picked from a small range of values, an attacker only needs to probe randomly chosen session IDs until they find a match.

- It is important that your Session IDs are generated by a strong random number algorithm, and are of sufficient length to be unguessable. 

- Below is a quick example of how easy it is for a hacker to get into your site if your sessions ID's are weak:

  - Hal is a hacker who wants to gain access to your site
  - After visiting your site, he opens up his browser debugger, and looks at the headers in the HTTP response. He notices that the Set-Cookie header includes a surprisingly small session ID.

  - Hal puts together a simple script to enumerate session IDs, and check the HTTP response code when each one is submitted to your site

  - The script can be run many times in parallel so it soon starts to spot session IDs already issued by your server

  - Then, Hal plugs one of these IDs into his browser, and he has hijacked somebody's session
