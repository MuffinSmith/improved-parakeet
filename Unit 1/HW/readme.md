### Before You Begin

1. Create a Google Drive (https://www.google.com/drive/) account if you do not already have one. 

2. Then create a folder called **01-Cyber-Report** inside your Google Drive.

3. Right-click the **01-Cyber-Report** folder and select **Get Shareable Link**. You will use this folder to submit your homework when complete and the folder needs to be shareable so we can access it.

4. Inside your **01-Cyber-Report** folder include each part of your assignment.

## Part I: Vocabulary Report

In this section of the assignment, you'll use independent research to define key terms found in the Security Reports. Then, you will use the [reports](resources/reports) themselves to communicate the significance of these key terms in their relative context. When communicating their context, you should offer a relevant factoid, case study, or explanation of their relevance in the report.

## Part II: Report Analysis

In this section of the assignment, you'll use each of the provided reports to answer a variety of questions relevant to current security landscape. For each question try to be detailed but succinct. Offer enough information to demonstrate your understanding of the subject, but keep your responses within a few bullets or sentences.

## Hints and Considerations

* This assignment should feel time-consuming! As you will discover in this class, each homework assignment is designed to challenge you in a different way. Some will be technically difficult, while others will be require close reading of detailed subject matter. Treat each task as a critical step in your goal of becoming a security professional.

* Feel encouraged to work closely with your classmates outside of class on this. It's a great opportunity to build bonds with your peers. You'll need them as you progress through class.

* If you struggle to answer a few questions, consider attending office hours before or after class to get help.
