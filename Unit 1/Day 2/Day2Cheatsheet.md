# Day 2 Cheat Sheet â€” Unit-Cyber101

## Key Terms
- **CIA Triad**: The three key objectives at the heart of computer security are the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information system assets.  These three properties form what is known as the CIA Triad.
  > **Example**: The use of encryption, cryptography, and redundancy can prevent hackers from unauthorized viewing of information (confidentiality), modifying data (integrity) or denying access (availability).

- **Confidentiality**: Confidentiality is the corner of the CIA Triad. It is concerned with preserving authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information.  
  > **Example**: Confidentiality is also a measurement of the attacker's impact on an application or system and dictates remediation actions.  An example is a vulnerability in the SSL protocol 3.0 that allows man-in-the-middle attacks to obtain data.  The impact confidentiality level for this attack is HIGH, and administrators implement software patches immediately.

- **Integrity**: Integrity refers to protecting data, applications, and systems from being modified by unauthorized parties including ensuring information nonrepudiation and authenticity.
  > **Example**:  A hack to your mobile banking app sends money transfers to the attacker's bank account.

- **Availability**: Availability occurs when operating systems, equipment, and data are functioning in a timely and reliable manner, and there is no disruption of service for legitimate users.
  > **Example**:  Millions of junk queries overwhelmed the "Dyn Managed DNS" directory service. The Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks disrupted the availability of service for users of Twitter, PayPal, GitHub, and others.

- **Incident**:  Actions taken that actually or potentially jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of any component of an information system (e.g., data, system, network).
  > **Example**: A data breach is an incident that jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of a company's information system.  

- **Vulnerability**:  A vulnerability is a weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source.
  > **Example**: A vulnerability in the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) improperly validates certificates during authentication. A hacker exploits this vulnerability to impersonate the client session.

- **Exploit**: An exploit is an attack that takes advantage of a vulnerability in a system. 
  > **Example**: Hackers exploited a vulnerability on one of the Equifax web servers which allowed access to hundreds of thousands of personal data records. 

- **Denial of Service Attack (DoS)**: DoS attacks prevent authorized access to a system resource, or stops/delays/depletes application or system resources, operations, and functions.
  > **Example**: A hacker uses an attack script that repeatedly generates an entry in an error log. This activity continues until the disk is full which crashes the application.

- **Zero Day Attack**:  This attack exploits previously unknown hardware, firmware, or software vulnerability without an available patch. 
  > **Example**: Hackers exploited an unknown vulnerability in the Adobe Flash Player by tricking users to download a Microsoft Word document which contained an embedded Flash file.  The file executed code to download malware to user's computers.

- **Remote Execution Attack**:  An attacker exploits a system vulnerability to allow remote execution of system level code.
  > **Example**: A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is software that is used to control a system remotely.  RATs are hard to detect because they are designed to change their characteristics (e.g., name, size).    

- **Memory Related Attack**:  Attack code targets types of inputs to cause memory errors (out of bounds errors, buffer overflow) or directly access memory.
  > **Example**: You design an attack program that overwrites a section of memory that contains a flag that makes you the system administrator.

- **Threat Actor**:  An individual or a group posing a threat. 
  > **Example**: Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) are state-controlled or sponsored groups that are responsible for high profile attacks such as the Stuxnet worm.
