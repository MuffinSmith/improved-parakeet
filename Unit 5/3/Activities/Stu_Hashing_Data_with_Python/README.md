# Hashing Data with Python

In this exercise, you'll use Python to hash the contents of a text file. You'll need to:
- Open and read the file contents
- Encode the file contents
- Use `hashlib` to generate the MD5 and SHA256 hashes of the file contents
- Print the hashes to the command line

## Instructions

Depending on your comfort with Python, you may:
- Create a new script and start from scratch
- Use the commented starter in `Unsolved/hashing_data.py`
- Use the scaffolded starter, in `Unsolved/hashing_data_scaffolded.py`
  - This fills out the code to open and read the file, and encode its contents.

To test your script, either create your own file to read, or use the file provided in `Unsolved/hash_me`.
