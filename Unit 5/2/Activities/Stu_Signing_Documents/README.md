# Signing Documents

In this activity, you'll use GPG to
- Sign documents
- Verify signatures
- Generate clearsigned documents and detached signatures

## Instructions

Create a new directory for this assignment, or simply save your work in `~/tmp`.

### Signing and Verifying Documents

- Store a small message in a file called `document`.

- Use GPG to sign and encrypt the document.

- Trade signed documents with your seat partner, and verify/decrypt each other's documents.

- Next, open your signed document in a text editor. It'll contain binary data, and be unintelligible, but you can still edit it. 

- Delete a random character, and trade the document with your seat partner again. What happens when you try to verify/decrypt?

### Clearsigned Documents

- Repeat the above exercise, but generate a clearsigned document instead of an encrypted one.

- Inspect the clearsigned document. What's the difference? How would you verify the signature?

### Verifying Detached Signatures

- Repeat the above exercise, but generate a detached signature.

## Questions

- What are the advantages to generating a detached signature? What are the disadvantages?
