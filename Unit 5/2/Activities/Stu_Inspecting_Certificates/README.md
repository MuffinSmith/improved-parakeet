# Researching Certificates

## Instructions

### Research

- To review: SSL Certificates are used to verify the authenticity of a server before establishing connections.

- There are different kinds of certificates, each with its own security guarantees. Research and fill in the definitions for the following:
  - **Self-Signed Certificates**:
  - **Domain-Validated Certificates**:
  - **Organization Validated Certificates**:
  - **Extended Validated Certificates**:

- Answer the questions below, and be prepared to share your answers with the class.
  - Which certificate offers the strongest security guarantees?
  - What do you need to prove/provide to receive a domain-validated certificate?
  - What do you need to prove/provide to receive an organization-validated certificate?
  - What do you need to prove/provide to receive an extended validated certificate?
  - When is it acceptable to use a self-signed certificate? When is it unacceptable?

### Inspecting Certificates

Open up the "Manage Certificates" dialog in Chrome, and follow the steps below.

- Click on the **Intermediate Certification Authorities** pane, and click on three or four certificates. 

- Look at the **Issued To**, **Issued By**, and **Valid from** properties in the pop-up. What do these mean?

    - Click on the **Details** pane. Look at the **Signature algorithm** and **Public Key** properties.

    - Which signature algorithms are most common? Which public keys are most common? How many bits are the public keys you see?

    - Next, click on the **Certification Path** pane. We haven't covered it yet, but take your best guess: What might a "certification path" be?

- Back in the same dialog where you select certificates to view, click on the **Trusted Root Certifications** pane. Click on two or three certificates.

  - Inspect the **Issued By** and **Issued To** properties. What do you notice?

  - Inspect the **Certification Path**. What do you notice?
