# The Day DES Died

NIST used a competition model to land on the standard that became AES. Competitions like these are also used to determine which standards we should phase out. 

RSA Security leveraged a similar model in their DES Challenges, in which cryptanalysts the world over uncovered weaknesses in the Data Encryption Standard (DES), the precursor to AES.

This exercise is your opportunity to learn more about it.
