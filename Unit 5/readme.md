## Unit 5: Cryptography

By the end of each class, students will be able to:

### Day 1: Learning Objectives

* Articulate the goals of cryptography: privacy, authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation.
* Discuss modern encryption standards, and in particular AES.
* Compare and contrast substitution and transposition ciphers.
* Explain how textual data can be represented in binary, octal, and hex.
* Determine the output of the XOR operation given two input bitstreams.
* Compare and contrast symmetric and asymmetric cryptography.
* Use OpenSSL to encrypt data with a symmetric key.

### Day 2: Learning Objectives

* Compare and contrast block and stream ciphers.
* Describe how public key cryptography uses a keypair for encryption and decryption.
* Use a command line program, GPG, to encrypt and sign documents with public/private keys.
* Describe how digital signatures use private and public keys to generate and verify signatures.
* Describe and explain how digital certificates verify digital entities

### Day 3: Learning Objectives

* Describe hashing and hash functions
* Generate hashes on the command line using the CLI tools `md5sum` and `sha256sum`.
* Discuss how hashing assists with forensic investigations
* Crack password hashes with rainbow tables and hashcat
