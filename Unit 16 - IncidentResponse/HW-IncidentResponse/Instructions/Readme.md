We will use three exercise files from malware-traffic-analysis.net and one 'shellshock.tar' that the instructor will give you.

Malware-traffic-analysis.net provides many open-source malware pcap files and activities for anyone to access and use to practice incident response and/or malware analysis.

We will use the files from:

   - What is the source port of the activity?
   
   - What is the destination port of the activity?
   
   - What are the MAC Addresses of the computers involved?
   
   - What is the host name of the internal machine?
   
   - Can you confirm the date and time this issue occurred?
   
   - How can you confirm if the snort alert is accurate?
   
   - Can you safely verify whether or not malware was downloaded?

   - If this issue needs to be mitigated, what steps should be taken with the infected machine?
   
   - What steps should be taken in regards to network security?
