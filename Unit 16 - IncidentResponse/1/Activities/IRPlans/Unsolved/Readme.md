#### Instructions

- This activity is a high-level overview of some different IR plans. For each plan, don't try to read the entire document, but rather give each plan a skim through, focusing mostly on the table of contents.

- Write down the type of institution or industry to which each of these IR plans belong.
- Compare the table of contents for each document.
  - Which sections do most of the documents have in common?
  - Which sections are less common?
  - What you find interesting or potentially useful?
  - Why?

- Pick one of the common sections and review the content across each of the plans.

- Prepare a short summary of the section that includes the following information:
  - What content is found in the section?
  - What value would the section provide during an incident?
  - Who is the primary audience for the section?
