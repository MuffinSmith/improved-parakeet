**The solutions file for Interpreting IR Plans**
  - **File** [Activities/IRPlans/Unsolved/Readme.md](Activities/IRPlans/Unsolved/Readme.md)

#### Instructions

- Review the type of institution or industry to which each of these IR plans belong.
    - **National Government (Homeland Security)**
    - **University (Carnegie Mellon)**
    - **State Government (Oregon)**
    - **University (Virginia Tech)**

- Compare the table of contents for each document with the students.
  - Ask the students which sections do most of the documents have in common?
    - **Solution**: Common Themes Include:
      - Introduction, Purpose and Scope
      - Authority, Training, and Definitions
      - Preparation, Detection and Containment

- Point out that while there are several common sections, all four of these plans are quite different and each of them have unique topics to fit their individual needs.
      - **Solution**: Less Common Themes Include:
        - Executive Summary, Document Structure, Audience
        - Insider Threats, Communications, Private Sector
        - Access Control, Forensics, Escalation

- Ask what the students found interesting or potentially useful and why.
      - **Some interesting things to point out:**:
        - The fact that all four plans are so different could be enlightening.
        - Many of the plans talk about the CIA triad by mentioning the 'Confidentiality, Integrity or Availability' of systems
      - **National Government (Homeland Security)**
        - This document is meant to be a framework and not a tactical or operational plan.
        - Many departments follow this plan including The DOJ, FBI, NCIJTF, and DHS
        - This plan has a 'Guiding Principles' section for affected parties to follow.
        - This plan also distinguishes between "Cyber Incident" and "Significant Cyber Incident"
      - **University (Carnegie Mellon)**
        - Carnegie Mellon has an entire "office" that is responsible for this document.
        - Describes an "Event" as any exception outside normal operations.
        - Talks about both PII and PHI
        - Carnegie calls their Analysts "Incident Response Handlers"
      - **State Government (Oregon)**
        - The Oregon State plan seems less official than the Nation Plan.
        - Students may find it interesting to know that there is a `CISO` position for the state of Oregon (and other states), responsible for state wide information security.
        - Oregon State has a position called an 'Incident Commander' that sounds like a SOC Analyst.
        - Oregon keeps a full-time 'Enterprise Security Office'(ESO) who's primary focus is on Analysis, but not detection of incidents. They respond to incidents reported by other offices.
      - **University (Virginia Tech)**
        - VT has their own section called "VT's Approach to Cyber Incident Response"
        - VT points out some very specific attacks like botnet DDoS attacks and Ransom Attacks.
        - VT has a chart of changes to the document.
- Go around the room and ask a few students to present their summary.
