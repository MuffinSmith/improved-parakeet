### Guided Practice: Wireshark Follow-up Practice

- In this activity, you will work on investigating a malware attack using a snort alert file and a network pcap.

#### Setup

**Important**: This exercise uses live malware. Start with using your Ubuntu VM to work in a contained environment.

- We will use exercise files from malware-traffic-analysis.net. This site provides many open-source malware pcap files and activities for anyone to access and use to practice incident response and/or malware analysis.

- Inside your VM, open the terminal and run `cd ~/Documents` to move to your documents folder.

- Run `mkdir Stormtheory` and `cd Stormtheory` to create and move into a working directory for this exercise.

- Run `wget https://malware-traffic-analysis.net/2019/02/23/2019-02-23-traffic-analysis-exercise.pcap.zip` and `wget https://malware-traffic-analysis.net/2019/02/23/2019-02-23-traffic-analysis-exercise-alerts.zip` to download the needed pcaps.

- Run `unzip '*.zip' && rm *.zip` to unzip the files.

- The password for these files is: 'infected'

#### Solutions

- Start by examining the snort file, and answer these questions:
    - What activity is snort reporting on? (Provide a few alert headlines)
        - "likely Evil EXE download from dotted Quad by MSXMLHTTP"
        - "ET Malware Windows executable sent when remote host claims to send an image"
        - "ET Trojan [PTsecurity] Trickbot Data Exfiltration"
    - What is the date and time of this alert?
        - 2019-02-23 19:27
    - What is the external IP address that snort is flagging for malicious activity?
        - 209.141.55.226
    - What is the internal IP address that snort is flagging for malicious activity?
        - 10.2.23.231
    - What is the source port of the activity?
        - 80
    - What is the destination port of the activity?
        - 49195

- Now, move into the pcap file.
    - Filter the pcap file to show you the conversation between the two machines that were identified in the snort alert.
        - `http.request and ip.addr eq 209.141.55.226 and ip.addr eq 10.2.23.231`
    - What is the MAC Addresses of the internal computer?
        - While inspecting this packet, under the 'Ethernet II' section, we can see that this is a likely a Windows machine with the name: `HewlettP` and the MAC Address: `(00:11:0a:9f:c0:2d)`
    - What is the host name of the infected machine?
        - Filter Wireshark for `bootp` which gives you `DHCP` traffic.
        - In the packet info, under the `Bootstrap Protocol` there is an `Option: (xx)Host Name`
        - This machine's host name is Ferguson-Win-PC
    - Can you confirm the date and time this issue occurred?
        - Confirmed: pcap shows 2019-02-23 14:27 UTC
    - How can you confirm if the snort alert is accurate?
        - Following the TCP stream shows binary data with '!This program cannot be run in DOS mode.'
        - Shows the file named 'troll1.jpg'
    - Can you safely verify whether or not malware was downloaded?
        - Using `File > Export Objects > HTTP`, choose the `troll1.jpg` file out of the list and save it.
        - Run `md5sum troll1.jpg` to hash the file.
        - Visit [Virus Total]() and paste in the hash to verify maleware.
    - Would you categorize this alert as a `False Positive` or a `True Positive`?
        - Malware was verified to be downloaded, so this snort alert is `True Positive`.
    - If this issue needs to be mitigated, what steps should be taken with the infected machine?
        - The Machine should be restored to a backup prior to this incident.
    - What steps should be taken in regards to network security?
        - We can use Wireshark to create a firewall rule:
            - Block #IPv4 malicious address.
            - iptables --append INPUT --in-interface etho --source 209.141.55.226/32 --jump DROP
                - Remember that this is only a suggestion from Wireshark as to what rule you _could_ add to your firewall. It is not actually changing any firewall rules.
    - Would you categorize this issue as a Web, Email or Network attack?
        - This attack was propagated by visiting a malicious web link, so this is a `Web Attack`.
