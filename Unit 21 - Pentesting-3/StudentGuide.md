# Student Guide
## Pentesting Unit 3

### Reviewing Last Week
Last week you went a little further with pentesting by exploring:
    - More advanced scanning and enumeration techniques
    - How to steal/**exfiltrate** data
    - How to create custom malware to exploit arbitrary targets

At this time, you should be familiar with the following:
- Use Metasploit to exploit Heartbleed and Shellshock.
- Perform advanced scans with **Nmap**
- Save and organize the results of these scans with Metasploit's **workspaces** and built-in **database**
- Perform a brute-force against an SSH server with **Hydra**
- Perform reconnaissance on compromised hosts.
- Transfer files between machines using Ncat
- Manually dump information from a MySQL database
- Crack password hashes with John the Ripper
- Creating malicious binaries with `msfvenom`
- Serving files to compromised hosts via HTTP
- Running Metasploit modules through backgrounded Meterpreter sessions

### Next Steps
This week you will start hacking Windows and exploiting `SMB` and `NetBIOS` vulnerabilities. You will also go a bit further into web attacks by exploring `SQL` injection vulnerabilities and exploits and we will revisit msfvenom and create our own malicious binaries.

### Topics for This Week

By the end of this week you will be able to:

- Exploit Windows machines with Metasploit modules
- Gather data via SMB enumeration*
- Leverage Meterpreter sessions to pillage data
- Use a compromised host to pivot between subnets
- Website enumeration with Nikto
- Testing for SQLi with Burp Suite
- Automated SQL injection with `sqlmap`
- Manually exploit SQLi vulnenrabilities
- Scanning and enumeration
- SSH brute-force
- Creating malicious binaries with msfvenom
- Uploading malicious files to target

### Homework for This Week


### Why We Care | Job Titles Related to These Skills

Pentesting weeks are all about Penetration Testing. Penetration Testing is a high paying role with an average U.S. Salary of $95k/year. Vulnerability Aanlyst, or completing Vulnerability assessments is also a related role that pays very well.
