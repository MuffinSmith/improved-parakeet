## Digital Forensics Day 1: Introduction to Autopsy 
--------

## Instructions 

In this activity, you will load evidence into Autopsy for analysis. Please follow the directions in the checklist. Ask your TAs for assistance if needed.

#### Prepare the Data

1. Start the Virtualbox application. 

1. Start the Kali-Linux-VM.

1. Open a terminal window.

1. Generate **md5** and **sha256** hashes for the evidence. This will be used to validate that nothing was changed during the investigation.

   * Run `md5sum tracy-phone-2012-07-15.final.E01 > tracy.original.md5log.txt`

   * Run `sha256sum tracy-phone-2012-07-15.final.E01 > tracy.original.sha256log.txt`


### Get Started: Create a Case

1. Next, navigate to the `autopsy-files/autopsy-4.10.0/bin` directory.

1. Start Autopsy: `./autopsy` 

### Step 1: Set Up the Case Information

1. Enter a **Case Name**: *day-month-year*-National-Gallery

1. Enter a **Base Directory**: `/root/casedata`

1. Enter a **Case Type**: Single-user

1. Select **Next**.

#### Enter the Optional Information:

1. Enter a **Case Number**: 1Nat347B

1. Enter **Name**, **Phone**, **Email**, and **Notes**. 

1. Enter the **Organization** that will provide more information if necessary.

   * Select **Manage Organizations** and then **New**.

   * Enter the **Organization Name** and **Point of Contact** information.

1. Select **Finish**.

### Step 2: Select Types of Data

1. Select **Disk Image or VM File** and **Next**.

1. Browse to where the evidence files are located on */root/corpus*.

   * Select *tracy-phone-2012-07-15.final.E01*.

1. Select an **E01 file** and **Open**.

1. Select **Time zone** and leave **Sector size** at **Auto Detect**.

1. Select **Next**.

### Step 3: Configure Ingest Modules

1. Configure the hash data sets. Select **Hash Lookup** and the NIST NSRL database is selected.

1. Set the **Additional Ingest Settings**:

   * **Keyword Search**

   * **Extension Mismatch Detector**

1. Select **Finish**.

*  Autopsy will analyze the files. When this process is finished, the file is ready. 

* This will take some time. A progress bar is located in the bottom right hand corner of the window. You can click on it to see the status.

 ### Step 4: View Output from Autopsy

 * When the ingest process is complete, locate the **Encryption Detection** area in the **Directory Tree** and open the *documents.zip* file to view the data in the image.

* Congratulations! You've finished the activity!
