### What is the case?

* Alex is seeking to embarrass America and damage public relations by defacing Foreign Art, belonging to Majavia and currently on display in the National Gallery during the month of July.  

* Tracy plans to steals stamps from the National Gallery.

* Joe, Tracy's soon to be ex-husband, installs a key logger and discovers the consiracy and reports to the police. 

### Who are the suspects?

 * **Alex** is a Krasnovian supporter who wishes to embarrass the United States. He is a foreigner and lives outside the country presumably in a region called Krasnovia. He knows Carry through extended family connections and contacts her as both having similar family ties and a fellow Krasnovian. He plans to deface foreign works that are on exhibit in the National Gallery DC. Defacing said artwork will embarrass the United States and possibly degrade the reputation between the United States and the foreign country providing the foreign exhibit to America. (In some documentation this is referred to as ‘Majavia’, a second pseudo-nation).
 
 * **Carry** is a somewhat criminally involved individual that shares family ties with Alex. She is a Krasnovian supporter. Carry is both technologically savvy and an occasional social media user. She is contacted by Alex in the beginning of the scenario and asked to orchestrate the defacing of the artwork because she is both aligned with Krasnovia and because she has ‘Connections’. She has a slight familiarity as friends/acquaintances with Tracy.

 * **Tracy** works as a supervisor at the National Gallery and is an acquaintance of Carry. Carry contacts Tracy and starts communicating small data as a back and forth under the auspices that Carry wants to organize a Flash mob at the gallery and needs a little help. Carry will give money to Tracy for this help. Items transferred are suspicious in nature but not outright illegal. Tracy’s money troubles help her overlook the suspicious nature of the requests.
 
 * **Joe** is the father of Terry and is currently going through the divorce with Tracy. Joe is financially well-off, and still bitter about the relationship problems. He previously installed a key logger on the MacBook Air in an attempt to keep track of Terry’s online behavior. Now that Joe and Tracy are going through a divorce, he has motivation to utilize the key logger to spy on both Tracy and Terry. Joe used to have an account on the family MacBook Air however it was deleted. The home folder may have been preserved.

 * **Terry** is the daughter of Tracy and Joe. Terry attends an expensive private school. (Prufrock Preparatory School). She wants to stay in school to avoid having to start over and so that she can keep her current friends, despite the fact that her mother can no longer afford to pay the tuition.

 * **Pat** is Tracy’s brother. He is a police officer of the D.C. Enforcers Bureau. He holds the status of detective. He is very devoted to his sister and niece Terry, to this point he isn’t an outright criminal, but walks the line very closely.

	 
* What **evidence** was confiscated?
	* Phones
	
	* Hard drives
	
	* Network dumps

*  What could be **admissible as evidence**?

	* Data on confiscated equipment such as emails, images, text messages, phone logs, web browing history.
