## Digital Forensics Day 1: The 2012 National Gallery Scenario
--------

## Instructions 

Welcome to your first forensics investigation activity! 

You are beginning investigators in the We-Carve-4-U digital forensics company. Your supervisor has a training case that will help you get ready for field work: you will analyze seized evidence that has been processed by the ingest team at the Crime Laboratory.

Teams are competing to see which group will be the first to go on a real case. You want your team to be the first! 

1. Start by reviewing the [*Stu_CaseScenario.md*](Activities/Stu_CaseScenario/The-2012-National-Gallery-Scenario.pdf) case file with your group.

2. As your team prepares for the investigation, think about the following:

   * What is the crime?

   * Who are the suspects?

   * What evidence was confiscated?

   * What could be admissible as evidence?

   * How should evidence be analyzed?

   * What laws apply to this case (e.g., Federal Privacy Act)?

* You will work on the questions as part of the homework exercise.
