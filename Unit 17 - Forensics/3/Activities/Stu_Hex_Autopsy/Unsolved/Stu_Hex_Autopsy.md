## Digital Forensics Day 3: Decoding Hex Data in Tracy's iPhone

### Instructions 

Welcome to the exercise.  In this Guided Practice, you will practice decoding using hex code strings.

### Getting Started

**Part 1:** Using pen, paper and the [standard ASCII table](http://www.asciitable.com) decode the following Hex strings to ASCII.

1. `48 65 6c 6c 6f 20 57 6f 72 6c 64`

2. `54 65 73 74 69 6e 67 20 31 32 33 21`

3. `41 6e 64 72 65 77`

4. `31 20 32 20 33 20 34 20 35 20 36`


Check your answers using the [Hex-to-Ascii Converter](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-ascii.html)


**Part 2:** 

Next, we'll look at a Hex dump from Tracy's iPhone**

Colleagues in your team send you a **hex dump** from Tracy's iPhone. They think the dump may contain evidence on Tracy's web browsing history. 

1. Open or download the [*Tracy-browsing-history*](Activities/Stu_Hex_Autopsy/Unsolved/Tracy-browsing-history-dump.txt) file.

2. You may use any tool (online converters or the standard Ascii table) to decode the hex dump.

3. Does it contain any web URLs?

    * Hint: Look for the `http://` sequence in **Hex**.

4. Record what you find in the *Group Evidence Worksheet*.
