## Digital Forensics Day 2: Tagging (Bookmarking) the Evidence
--------

## Instructions 

Welcome to the evidence tagging activity! 

Tagging allows you to quickly find data in the Autopsy iPhone image quickly and to document the evidence.

* Use the [*Stu_iPhone-Image-FileLayout.pdf*](Activities/Stu_Tagging/Stu-iPhone-Image-FileLayout.pdf) file to select the content to tag. You can also bookmark/tag other files of interest.

* Add **new tags** for evidence that would be of interest (e.g., mail, address book, SMS).

* You can complete the tagging as part of the homework assignment if you do not finish during the activity.

* Please consult your TA if you need assistance.
