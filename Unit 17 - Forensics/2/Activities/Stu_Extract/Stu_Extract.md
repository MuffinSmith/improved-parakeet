## Digital Forensics Day 2: Extracting Evidence for Offline Analysis
--------

## Instructions 

Welcome to the data extracting activity! 

In this activity, you will practice exporting a single file and an entire directory for offline analysis. This is necessary for video and voice data. It also allows for quicker viewing and parsing the data.

#### Export One File

First, practice exporting one file to the `Export` directory in Kali Linux.

1. Locate the `call_history.db` file in the iPhone image file.

1. Extract the file to the `Export` database.

1. Open another terminal window and navigate to the directory that contains the extracted file. All exports are located in the `casedata` directory.

1. This file can only be viewed with a SQL application.

#### Export an Entire Directory

Now practice exporting an entire directory and viewing a file in Kali.

1. Select the `vol5/logs` directory in the `Directory Tree` pane.

1. Export the entire directory to the `Export` directory.

1. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the `Export` directory that contains the extracted directory.

#### Analyze the Data

1. View the `lockdownd.log.1` file in the nano editor.

1. **Parse** the file and **extract Tracy's phone number**. 

*  Congratulations. The activity is complete!
